Hi

I'll give you some information about the files and their use:

CAudioCD.h & CAudioCD.cpp:
    That's the files what it's all about. They contain the class CAudioCD which helps
    you extracting audio-tracks from a cd. Take a look at the example-file.

    class CAudioCD
    {
        // Constructor / Destructor
        CAudioCD( char Drive='\0' );
        ~CAudioCD();

        // Open / Close access to cd-drive
        BOOL Open( char Drive );
        BOOL IsOpened();
        void Close();

        // Read / Get track-data
        ULONG GetTrackCount();
        ULONG GetTrackTime( ULONG Track );
        ULONG GetTrackSize( ULONG Track );
        BOOL ReadTrack( ULONG Track, CBuf<char>* pBuf );
        BOOL ExtractTrack( ULONG Track, LPCTSTR Path );

        // Lock / Unlock the cd-drive
        BOOL LockCD();
        BOOL UnlockCD();

        // General operations
        BOOL InjectCD();
        BOOL IsCDReady( char Drive='\0' );
        BOOL EjectCD();
    };


CBuf.h:
    Contains a class CBuf. It's a pretty simple buffer-class.


AudioCD_Helpers.h & AudioCD_Helpers.cpp:
    These files contain some definitions and structures needed by the CAudioCD-class.
    The only important thing is the CWaveFileHeader class. It creates a header
    for a wave-file. You only have to specify the audio-attributes.
